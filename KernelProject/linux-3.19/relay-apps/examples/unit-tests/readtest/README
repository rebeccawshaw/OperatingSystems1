Change KDIR in Makefile to point to the kernel source

# make
# mount -t debugfs debugfs /debug

Then either run the run-tests or overnight-tests script or do it
manually using readtest options:

# insmod ./readtest-mod.ko
# ./readtest [options]

No output - readtest calculates results

NOTE: for all tests to pass, this unit test must be run on a UP
system, since some tests expect the reader and writer to be on the
same cpu.
