Exported relayfile apps - there are two examples here, both
demonstrating how relay files can be used in other pseudo-filesystems
e.g. debugfs.

NOTE: all examples have been converted to having their files created
in debugfs, so this example is no longer illustrates a special case.

The exported-percpu example creates per-cpu relay files in the debugfs
filesystem. i.e. this code is pretty much the same as the other
relay examples, with the exception that the relay files live under
/debug or wherever debugfs is mounted.

The exported-global example creates a global relay file in the debugfs
filesystem and uses read(2) to read from it.  It amounts to pretty
much the simplest possible usage of relay for ad hoc kernel logging.

Change KDIR in Makefile to point to the kernel sources and then
'make'.


exported-percpu usage:

# mount -t debugfs debugfs /debug
# insmod ./exported-percpu-mod.ko
# ./exported-percpu [-b subbuf-size -n n_subbufs]
# ^C to stop logging

captured output will appear in ./cpu0...cpuN-1


exported-global usage:

# mount -t debugfs debugfs /debug
# insmod ./exported-global-mod.ko
# ./exported-global [-b subbuf-size -n n_subbufs]
# ^C to stop logging

captured output will appear on stdout
